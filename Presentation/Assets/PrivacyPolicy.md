## Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 25 November 2025

Welcome to PROHack ("we", "our" or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use the PROHack desktop application, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices that are available to you.

### 1. Information We Collect

We only collect the information strictly necessary to understand basic usage patterns:

- **Hashed IP address** (a one-way cryptographic hash of your IP address, used to estimate unique users)
- **Application version number** (the release identifier of the PROHack build you launched ex: 1.3.1)
- **Application open timestamp** (date and time when the app was launched)

We do not store raw IP addresses. We do not intentionally collect names, emails, or other identifying content through the app interface.

### 2. How We Use This Information

We use the above information solely to:

- Measure unique and recurring usage so we understand how many users rely on each release
- Detect adoption trends of new versions

We do **not** sell, rent, or otherwise monetize this data, and we do not use it for advertising or profiling.

### 3. Legal Basis

Our processing is based on our legitimate interest in understanding how our software is used and ensuring service reliability. By downloading and using PROHack, you consent to this minimal data collection. If you do not agree, please uninstall the application.

### 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not disclose hashed IP addresses, timestamps, or other telemetry to third parties except:

- When required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes
- To protect the rights, property, or safety of PROHack, our users, or the public

### 5. Data Retention

Hashed IP addresses, version numbers and timestamps are retained indefinitely to track long-term usage trends and user growth. All retained data is stored securely and used only for the purposes outlined in this policy.

### 6. Data Security

We apply reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect telemetry data, including encrypted transport, access controls, and periodic reviews. No system can be 100% secure; if you suspect any unauthorized access, please contact us immediately.

### 7. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on where you reside, you may have rights to request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal data we store about you, as well as rights to object to or restrict processing. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below. Because our telemetry contains minimal identifiers, we may need additional information to verify your request.

### 8. International Data Transfers

If you access PROHack from outside the country where our servers are located, your data may be transferred to and processed in a jurisdiction with different data-protection laws. We rely on legally recognized safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) where required.

### 9. Children’s Privacy

PROHack is not designed for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under that age. If you believe a minor has provided us with data, contact us so we can delete it.

### 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will change the "Effective date" above and, when feasible, provide an in-app notice. Continued use of PROHack after the updated policy takes effect constitutes acceptance of the changes.

### 11. Contact Us

If you have questions or requests regarding this policy, email us at **spam.insertokname@gmail.com**. We aim to respond to all privacy inquiries within 30 days.

If you disagree with any part of this Policy, please uninstall PROHack and discontinue using the application.
